# Readable Project

Readable is a post/comments app created during the Udacity's React Nanodegree Course which allows the user to include, edit and delete posts as well as their associated comments.

The post listing may be honored according to the following criteria: Most Recents, Most Comments, Post Score and Post Author. 

## Installation

The following steps will help you install and run the Readable frontend application and the api-server on your local computer.

git clone: https://github.com/Caxandre/Readable.git

* Install all frontend and api-server dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`

* Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process we used the backend server provided by Udacity, called api-server and made available in this repository ..
